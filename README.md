### üìå Introduction
This project is the main contribution to the [AI Hackfest 2025](https://ai-hackfest-23772.devpost.com/)  \
It forms the core of the solution, complemented by a secondary component hosted in this repository: \
üëâ [ai-hackfest-webstore](https://github.com/StephanieHhnbrg/ai-hackfest-webstore).

The project is about mail marketing and tackles the problem of customers having overloaded inboxes, causing newsletters to go unnoticed, reducing their impact.
The goal is to boost sales and increase click-through rates (CTR) by delivering more effective and personalized content.

To achieve this,an AI-powered Marketing Platform, called Marketeer, was built that leverages A/B testing to optimize email campaigns and ensure they reach their full potential.
#### How does it work?
By describing events and adding it to the e-commerce calendar, email-campaigns are created automatically. Using the model `gemini-1.5-pro-001` two unique emails variants A & B are crafted for each event.
The customers (stored in the Firestudio Collection `users`) are split into A/B testing groups, and emails are sent autonomously. 

Each email contains a CTA button linking to a fake e-commerce store (hosted in [ai-hackfest-webstore](https://github.com/StephanieHhnbrg/ai-hackfest-webstore)).
The webstore is designed to track user behavior and collect interaction metrics. These metrics are then visualized in real-time on the Marketeer platform to evaluate performance and guide improvements.

Alongside the Angular frontend, this repository also includes Python backend scripts deployed via Google Cloud Run for handling data fetching, campaign generation, mail delivery, tracking, and analytics.
